# TODO:

#### Available Data Categories:

Identify 8 or more related documents. The type of file you choose is entirely up to you, but I recommend something diEerent than presidential inaugural speeches or song lyrics. (Been 
there, done that.) Some possible ideas or data sources: 

• Project Gutenberg (www.gutenberg.org) 
• Political speeches 
• National constitutions 
• Tweet compilations 
• Corporate filings 
• Letters/Journals/Diaries 
• News articles or blog posts 
• Religious texts 
• Philosophical tracts 
• AI-generated text

We can also propose other textual sources if anyone wants to meet w/ him about something they really want to do.

#### Action Items
- get data 
- build parsers
- build graphing framework (must adhere to instructions specs for fxns)
- connect pipes in executable.py
